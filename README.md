This repository contains several files related to combinatorics optimization of banana crop cycles. Whenever you rely on any of the algorithms, please cite the source. Thanks. 

# all-compositions.sce
A simple scilab algorithm to list all the k-parts compositions of an integer n in the lexicographic order. It is useful in the brute force optimization. 

# brute-force.sce
A brute-force optimization algorithm deciding whether to uproot banana plants and fallow after the end of cropping seasons or to rely on plant natural reproduction. all the possibilities are defined by the all-compisition algorithm.
